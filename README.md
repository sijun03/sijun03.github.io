# Codisoul — Future Imperfect (Single Page) Starter

This folder contains a ready `index.html` and placeholder images for your Codisoul site.
**You must also add the `assets/` folder from the HTML5 UP *Future Imperfect* template**.

## Steps

1) Download the template: https://html5up.net/future-imperfect
2) Unzip and copy the entire `assets/` folder into this directory (next to `index.html`).
3) Replace placeholder images in `images/` with your real visuals:
   - `images/logo.png` — 200x200 PNG (transparent if possible)
   - `images/thinking-hero.jpg` — 1200x500
   - `images/spaced-cards-hero.png` — 1200x500
   - `images/roadmap-wireframe.png` — 1200x500
   - `images/avatar.jpg` — 100x100 (optional)
4) Open `index.html` in VS Code → use Live Server to preview.
5) Publish with Git (VS Code Source Control): Stage → Commit → Push.

## Notes
- This keeps the original Future Imperfect styling (fonts, CSS, spacing).
- Edit text directly in `index.html` to adjust copy (Thinking, Spaced Cards, Roadmap, Contact).
- Your custom domain is locked by adding a `CNAME` file with `codisoul.site` at repo root.
